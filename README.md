# Kubernetes Deployments

This repository contains a variety of deployments and scripts for demoing and playing with AKS. A lot of this is focused on Windows and integrating Windows workloads in an AKS cluster.

## Disclaimer

- Nothing is guaranteed to work
- Everything is used at own risk (I reference binaries, which other people publish)...
- Documentation and guides are provided on a best effort basis
- This is mainly just my playground and notebook

I hope you can use some of this for great experiences!!!
